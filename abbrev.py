def dunning_log_likelihood(count_a, count_b, count_ab, N):
    """
    Calculates the modified Dunning log-likelihood ratio score for determining
    whether a token and a following period (e.g., 'Dr.') form a single unit,
    as opposed to occurring independently (e.g., 'Dr .' with a space).

    Parameters:
        count_a (int): Total occurrences of the token with and without the period.
        count_b (int): Total occurrences of period tokens in the corpus.
        count_ab (int): Occurrences of the token followed immediately by a period.
        N (int): Total number of tokens in the corpus.

    Returns:
        float: Dunning log-likelihood score â€” higher values indicate stronger
               association between the token and the period (more likely to be
               a single unit like an abbreviation).
